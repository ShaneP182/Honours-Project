Honours Project Artefact - Procedurally Generated Lightning

Created in Unreal Engine 5.0

Two models for procedurally generating lightning - one based on L-systems, the other based on real physics.

Controls:
T - toggle ImGui interface clickability
R - reset camera position
Esc - exit application

W,A,S,D - move camera
Mouse - rotate camera

The ImGui interface can be used to adjust the parameters of the lightning. There are settings for the physics model, L-system, shader, generator and more.
